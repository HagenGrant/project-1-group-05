Data boot camp project 1 for group 05

[Check out our jupyter notebook](/Shark%20Attacks.ipynb)

Here we take a look at shark attack data over time and across the world as we look to organize our data into usable and descriptive visualizations to present our findings. Using a data set from Kaggle, we clean, organize and evaluate interconnected values reported about sharks and their victims to uncover what factors can be used to predict future shark attacks. We take a large and diverse data set and clean and organize it to create a clear and concise data frame. We asked what locations are most associated with shark attacks? What factors of the victims related to increased chances of shark attacks and what variables were directly correlated to fatalities? 

Included is our jupyter notebook, our original CSV, the slide deck we make to present our findings and our write up of our analysis.
